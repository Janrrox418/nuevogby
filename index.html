          <p>Medical Esthetician,DA,PBT</p>
          <p>
            My name is Gabriela Hernández, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to the beauty in people—not the kind you see in photos, but the kind that shines from within when someone feels confident, cared for, and understood.
            My story began in Venezuela, where for 20 years I worked in a plastic surgery outpatient practice. I witnessed something powerful there: the way a small change, a kind word, or a moment of care could lift someone’s spirit. Those experiences shaped my heart and my purpose.
            Ten years ago, life brought me to the United States with my two children. Starting over was not easy, but it gave me strength and reminded me why I love what I do. In 2017, I earned my Esthetician License in Naples, Florida, and continued training to become a Medical Aesthetician and phlebotomist. Every course, every certification, every new technique I learn is my way of giving more—of offering my patients the safest, most thoughtful, and most honest care possible.
            For me, skincare is not about perfection or erasing time. It’s about honoring yourself. It’s about looking in the mirror and recognizing the person you’ve become—stronger, wiser, and still beautifully you. My goal is to help you feel refreshed, renewed, and confident in your own skin.
            Outside of work, my heart lives with my two children in Gainesville. Visiting them fills me with joy and reminds me of why I keep growing, learning, and giving my best every day.
            My hope is that when you come to see me, you don’t just receive a treatment—you feel seen, supported, and cared for. Because every person deserves to feel beautiful, inside and out.

          <p>
            From an early age, medicine captured my heart. What began as a fascination watching medical films grew into a lifelong vocation. I became a physician in my home country, and upon arriving in the United States, I continued my path through nursing studies while advancing toward my doctorate. 
            With more than two decades of experience in the medical and aesthetic fields, I am devoted to continuous learning and to elevating the care I provide each day.
            Living in Naples has become a blessing—its serene beaches are my favorite escape, and walking by the ocean keeps me grounded. Above all, I treasure the moments I share with my family and friends, who inspire me to grow both personally and professionally.

              <p><strong>✨ What it is:</strong> A next-generation, medical-grade facial that cleanses, exfoliates, hydrates,

                <strong>Lite Ultrasound (LUX) –</strong> Micro-vibrations that smooth skin and enhance absorption.<br>
                <strong>Lymphatic Massage –</strong> Detoxifies, reduces puffiness, and sculpts contours.

                <strong>Red light –</strong> Boosts collagen, reduces inflammation.<br>
                <strong>Blue light –</strong> Kills acne bacteria, calms breakouts.<br>
